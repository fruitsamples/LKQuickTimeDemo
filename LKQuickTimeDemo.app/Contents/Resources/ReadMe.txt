LKQuickTimeDemo

This sample code demonstrates how to use LayerKit on Leopard together with QuickTime and a visual context. For some eye-candy, it shows some funky frequency level indicators.
When launched the first time, the app will ask for a movie that has some audio (otherwise the frequency levels won't work).
